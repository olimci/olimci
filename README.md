# hey, i'm oli!

i'm a physics undergrad at durham university, with a deep interest in machine learning, statistical mechanics, and using network protocols in unintended ways. 

i spend a lot of time building random tools, frameworks, or small experiments, sometimes for work, sometimes for uni, and sometimes just for fun.

outside of coding, i'm a bit of a adrenaline junkie:  i spend a lot of my free time mountain biking climbing or snowboarding. i also into photography, and i'm working on getting my japanese to a conversational level.
