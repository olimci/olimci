# Hey! I'm Oli ^_^

I'm a 3rd year physics student at Durham University. I'm into machine learning, statistical physics, and network protocols.

When I’m not studying or coding, I’m usually climbing, snowboarding, or trying to understand something random.

You can see my website and cv at [oli.mcinnes.cc](https://oli.mcinnes.cc/)

Feel free to check out any of my repos, or send me an email at [oli@mcinnes.cc](mailto://oli@mcinnes.cc)

Thanks for stopping by!
